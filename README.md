# 🎭 Emotion Detection Using Facial Expressions

This is a deep learning-based emotion detection project that recognizes human emotions from facial expressions in real time. The model was trained using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and the user interface was built using **Streamlit** for an interactive experience.
